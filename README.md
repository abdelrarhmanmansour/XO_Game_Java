# XO Game Java
ğŸš€ XO Game Project << Java

Iâ€™m thrilled to share my latest project, an XO (Tic-Tac-Toe) game built using Java, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and Unit Testing. This project simulates a classic two-player game with a console-based interface, showcasing my ability to design and implement clean, modular, and well-tested code.

Key Features:

ğŸ”´ Game Board Module:
âœ… Dynamic Board Management: Used a 2D character array to represent the 3x3 game grid, initialized with numbers (1-9) for player reference.
âœ… Move Validation: Implemented methods to check if a cell is empty (Is_Empty) and validate player moves.
âœ… Win and Draw Logic: Developed functions to check for winning combinations (rows, columns, diagonals) and detect a draw when the board is full.
âœ… Board Display: Created a Draw method to display the board in a user-friendly format after every move.

ğŸ”´ Player Module:
âœ… Player Class: Designed a Player class to store player details (name and symbol: X or O).
âœ… Encapsulation: Used getters and setters for managing player attributes.
âœ… Symbol Assignment: Automatically assigned the second playerâ€™s symbol (X or O) based on the first playerâ€™s choice.

ğŸ”´ Game Flow Module:

âœ… Interactive Gameplay: Used Scanner for user input to collect player names, symbols, and move positions.
âœ… Turn Management: Alternated turns between two players using a counter.
âœ… Real-Time Updates: Displayed the updated board after each move and checked for win/draw conditions.
âœ… Edge Case Handling: Ensured valid moves by checking for out-of-bounds indices and occupied cells.

Technical Implementation:
âœ… OOP Concepts:

Designed three core classes (Board, Player, Game) for modularity and reusability.

Encapsulated data and methods within classes for better organization.

âœ… Unit Testing:

Conducted thorough testing to validate game logic, including board initialization, move validation, win/draw conditions, and edge cases.

âœ… Error Handling:

Implemented checks for invalid inputs and ensured smooth gameplay without crashes.

âœ… Console-Based Interface:

Provided a simple and intuitive interface for players to interact with the game.

Phases of Development:

âœ… Phase 1: Designed the Board and Player classes with core functionalities (e.g., move validation, win/draw logic).

âœ… Phase 2: Built the Game class to manage the game flow, including player input and turn alternation.

âœ… Phase 3: Added unit tests to ensure the correctness of game logic and edge case handling.

âœ… Phase 4: Polished the user interface and added clear messages for game outcomes (win, draw, invalid moves).


Tools & Technologies:
âœ… Java: Core programming language.
âœ… OOP: Encapsulation, modularity, and clean code practices.
âœ… Unit Testing: Ensured robust and error-free game logic.
âœ… Console I/O: Used Scanner for user input and displayed the board dynamically.

This project was an excellent opportunity to apply OOP principles, unit testing, and problem-solving skills in a fun and interactive way.
It reinforced my understanding of Java and highlighted my ability to create structured, maintainable, and well-tested code.
